# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
12 weeks of Data Science tutorials, all part of University of Michigan's SI 370: Data Exploration in Fall 2017.

SI 370 provided me an incredibly holisitic overview of the most up-to-date tools, techniques, and practices for doing Data Science -- so I thought I'd share it all here for others who are also trying to master the fundamentals.

This repository serves as a collection of all the labs, lectures, and homeworks from each week of the class.

In each .zip file above, you'll find the corresponding Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), images (.jpeg, .png), and datasets (mostly .csv files) for that assignment.
